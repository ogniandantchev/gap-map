Basic correlations are evaluated to help answer the original project questions "What makes us sick?" and "How does the environment we live in influence our health?". Python 3 functions are implemented for the visualization of: two variables for all countries over time (animated GIF), choropleth for one variable all countries over the world map and one vatiable over time for a given list of countries.
